# Transformer GARCH Models For Portfolio Optimisation

## Description
This repository contains the resources and code for my master's thesis titled "Transformer GARCH Models For Portfolio Optimisation". The thesis focuses on the development and application of (MP-MTL-GARCH) model for financial forecasting and portfolio optimization.

## Contents

- `Notebooks/`: Contains all the code used in the analysis and model development.
- `Portfolio_scripts/`: Notebooks used to generate the portfolios using the MP-MTP-GARCH and using historical methods
- `Tuning/`: Hyper-parameter tuning.
- `Volatilty Forecasting/`: Generating volatility forecasts using benchmarks (Egarch, Figarch) and the MP-MTL-GARCH
- `src/`: Additional documentation, including supplementary files.

## Usage
[Instructions on how to use the code or navigate the repository, e.g., "To replicate the analysis, navigate to the `code/` directory and follow the instructions in the `README.md` file located within."]

## Acknowledgments
- The research and code development in this thesis were heavily inspired by and based upon the work of Eduardo Ramos-Pérez et al., 2021. Their original work on the MTL-GARCH model provided a foundational framework for my thesis. Their Github can located here: https://github.com/EduardoRamosP/MultiTransformer
